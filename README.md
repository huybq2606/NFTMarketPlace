# NFT_MarketPlace

Project Objectives:
To incentivize members to participate in club activities, such as workshops, newsletters, and hackathons. This will be achieved through the exclusive distribution of club ‘BNS’ tokens.
To provide club members a platform to gain hands-on experience how a NFT marketplace operates in a safe environment (E.g. Setting up a wallet and signing transactions, minting their own NFT, participating in a NFT auction)
A learning opportunity for club members looking to learn more about blockchain development and software engineering this 2021 winter break.

Overview:
We will set up a website for club members to mint ‘BNS’ tokens upon the completion of an activity, leveraging smart contracts deployed on a testnet. ‘BNS’ tokens can then be exchanged for other items.

Club members will be able to earn BNS tokens by actively participating in club activities, like attending workshops, finishing quizzes after reading newsletter articles, and teaming up to participate in the blockchain hackathons.
BNS tokens can be used to redeem digital and physical club merchandise, such as specially designed Zoom backgrounds and physical club goods (T-shirts and Lanyards), at a certain exchange ratio.

Development Goals:
Create a BNS token as a form of utility for the benefit of the club
Set up a NFT marketplace as an educational platform for club members to explore the functions of blockchain applications
Design NFTs that appeal to club members and will serve as useful publicity for the club
